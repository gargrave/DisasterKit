# disaster_kit

A small app to help us manage our emergency supplies.


Some commands I will be using over and over:


#### Activate venv (+wrapper):
```
$venvw && workon dkenv
```

#### Set a shortcut for launching server with dev settings:
```
export run="python manage.py runserver --settings=disasterkit.settings.dev"
```
